# Trust Model Simulator and Data Generator 
Trust model simulator and data generator to test the latest MVoT calculations.

## System
Both the trust model simulator and data generator have been tested on Linux and macOS.<br />
This how-to guide mimics the process on a Linux machine running Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.<br />
This is a Python-based program tested on Python 3.8.5. Other versions of Python3 should 
work but haven't been tested.

## Dependencies 
To run the simulator, the Pandas library must be installed. <br />
To install Pandas, start by installing pip3
````
sudo apt install python3-pip
````

Once pip3 is installed, install Pandas

````
pip3 install pandas
````

## Running the Trust Mode Data Generator
````
python3 TMsimDataGenerator.py -f [FILENAME] -p [PROFILE] -n [NUMBER OF DATA POITNS] -i [TIMESTEP] -pa {optional} [PROFILE ADDONS] -ma {optional} [MIXED ARGS] -db {optional} [DER BIAS]
````
FILENAME - The name of the file you are generating. This must be a csv file (.csv) <br />

PROFILE - The profile you want the generated data to be. Pick one of the profiles available below. <br />
    ideal - This profile only generates expected data<br />
    random - This randomly assigns a message evaluation to a random actor <br />
    flawed - This profile generates no expected messages<br />
    almost_good - This profile generates expected messages until the last set <br />
    almost_bad - This profile generates Ux, Ind, Dis, N messages until the last set<br />

N DATA POINTS - The number of messages to be generated per actor <br />

TIMESTEP - The increment between each message <br /> 

PROFILE ADDONS - Allows for special funcitonality in some profiles <br />
    Random profile - if PROFILE ADDONS is 1, each data point will have a random timestamp <br />
    almost_good - if PROFILE ADDONS is not zero, PROFILE ADDONS value will be where a UX message is added <br />
    almost_bad - if PROFILE ADDONS is not zero, PROFILE ADDONS value will be where a EX message is added <br />

MIXED ARGS - Allows the user to specify the profiles to be used in the mixed profile <br />

DER BIAS - Alows the user to specify how many more DERs should be generated 
### Example 
````
python3 TMsimDataGenerator.py -f test.csv -p ideal -n 100 -i 1
````
This example generates a file called test.csv, the message evaluation for all the actors will be expected. <br />
There will be 100 messages per actor (400 messages total) and there is 1-sec step in the time

````
python3 TMSimDataGenerator.py -f testMixed.csv -p mixed -n 100 -i 1 -ma ideal mixed flawed
````
This example generates a file called testMixed.csv, the message evaluation will be mixed between ideal, mixed, and flawed. <br />

## Running the Trust Mode Simulator
````
python3 TMsim.py -f [FILENAME] -e [EQUATION] -d [DEBUG]
````
FILENAME -  The name of the file you generated. This must be a csv file (.csv)<br />

EQUATION -  The equation version to be used. This is to allow for multiple equation versions. <br />
            For now, there is only one version of equations so use "v1" when running. <br />

DEBUG    -  This parameter allows for the simulator to run one message at a time. <br />
            It will require the user to press a button to move to the next message. <br />
            Options: <br />
                y   - run simulator in debug mode <br />
                n   - run simulator automatically

### Example 
````
python3 TMsim.py -f test.csv -e v1 -d n
````
This example would provide test.csv as an input to the simulator. The simulator will run using the first
version of the MVoT equations and will be running in automatic mode.

### Running CDTA Merger Script 
````
python3 merger.py -f [FILE 1] [FILE 2] ... [FILE N] -o [MERGEDFILENAME]
````
To run the CDTA merger script is to list all the csv files that you would like to merger 
in the current directory. The script will run on all the csv files entered in the command line same directory that it is in. If there are 
csv files with a different format, it might cause issues.  
Next define the output file name where the mereged file data will be combined.

MERGEDFILENAME -  The name of the file you generated. This must be a csv file (.csv)<br />

### Example
````
python3 merger.py -f test1_SimOut.csv test2_SimOut.csv testN_SimOut.csv -o mergedtestfiles.csv
````

### Running CDTA Per Time Script
````
python3 perTPlots.py -f [FILE] -t [TIME] -i [INCREMENT] 
````
FILENAME -  The name of the file to read from (csv)<br />

TIME -  The sample size of the data in seconds. i.e. using 60 will give the last value per minute <br />

INCREMENT  -  The number of hours you want within the data set <br />
